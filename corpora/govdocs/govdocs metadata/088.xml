The final version is available from Oxford University Press via http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzv076</description><description>The Humean argument concerning miracles says that one should always think it more likely that anyone who testifies to a miracle is lying or deluded than that the alleged miracle actually occurred, and so should always reject any single report of it. A longstanding and widely accepted objection is that even if this is right, the concurring and non-collusive testimony of many witnesses should make it rational to believe in whatever miracle they all report. I argue that on the contrary, even multiple reports from non-collusive witnesses lack the sort of independence that could make trouble for Hume.</description><date>2016-06-21T07:45:56Z</date><date>2016-06-21T07:45:56Z</date><date>2015-08-04</date><type>Article</type><identifier>https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/256395</identifier><identifier>10.17863/CAM.338</identifier><language>en</language><publisher>Oxford University Press</publisher></simpledc>
