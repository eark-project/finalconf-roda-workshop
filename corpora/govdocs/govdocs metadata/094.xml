It first appeared from Springer via http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-016-1146-5</description><description>I show that the social stratification of academic science can arise as a result of academicsâ€™ preference for reading work of high epistemic value. This is consistent with a view on which academic superstars are highly competent academics, but also with a view on which superstars arise primarily due to luck. I argue that stratification is beneficial if most superstars are competent, but not if most superstars are lucky. I also argue that it is impossible to tell whether most superstars are in fact competent or lucky, or which group a given superstar belongs to, and hence whether stratification is overall beneficial.</description><description>This work was partially supported by the National Science Foundation under grant SES 1254291.</description><date>2016-09-14T16:25:58Z</date><date>2016-09-14T16:25:58Z</date><date>2016-09-24</date><type>Article</type><identifier>https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/260155</identifier><identifier>10.17863/CAM.4381</identifier><language>en</language><rights>Attribution 4.0 International</rights><rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</rights><publisher>Springer</publisher></simpledc>
