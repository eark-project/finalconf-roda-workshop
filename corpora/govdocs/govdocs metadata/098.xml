My main aim in this paper is to critique such deflationary appeals to ordinary language. Focussing on Thomasson, I draw two very general conclusions. First: ordinary language is a wildly complicated phenomenon. Its implicit ontological commitments can only be tackled by invoking a context principle; but this will mean that ordinary language ontology is not a trivial enterprise. Second: ordinary language often points in different directions simultaneously, so that a wide variety of existence questions cannot be deflated merely by appealing to ordinary language.</description><date>2016-10-28T13:33:26Z</date><date>2016-10-28T13:33:26Z</date><date>2016-09-13</date><type>Article</type><identifier>https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/260950</identifier><identifier>10.17863/CAM.6052</identifier><language>en</language><rights>Attribution 4.0 International</rights><rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</rights><publisher>Springer</publisher></simpledc>
