The incentive salience account of addiction proposed by Robinson and Berridge (1–3) entails that addictive desires are not in their nature different from many of the desires had by non-addicts; what is different is rather the way that addictive desires are acquired, which in turn affects their strength. We examine these “incentive salience” desires, both in addicts and non-addicts, contrasting them with more cognitive desires. On this account, the self-control challenge faced by addicted agents is not different in kind from that faced by non-addicted agents – though the two may, of course, differ greatly in degree of difficulty. We explore a general model of self-control for both the addict and the non-addict, stressing that self-control may be employed at three different stages, and examining the ways in which it might be strengthened. This helps elucidate a general model of intentional action.</description><date>2015-01-26T15:06:20Z</date><date>2015-01-26T15:06:20Z</date><date>2014-10-09</date><type>Article</type><type>published version</type><identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2014.00139</identifier><identifier>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/246607</identifier><language>en</language><rights>Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</rights><rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/uk/</rights><publisher>Frontiers</publisher></simpledc>
