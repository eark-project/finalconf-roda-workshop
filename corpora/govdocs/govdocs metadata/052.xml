Such truths, Jago argues, can only be dealt with using maximalist resources. I argue that Jago's point relies on the claim that the relevant truths require truthmakers, a point that non-maximalists can coherently and plausibly deny. Moreover, I argue that by making use of a safety account of knowledge, non-maximalists can fully answer Jago's challenge.</description><description>AHRC</description><date>2014-11-06T12:03:55Z</date><date>2014-11-06T12:03:55Z</date><date>2014-12-05</date><type>Article</type><type>published version</type><identifier>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/246298</identifier><identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tht3.144</identifier><language>en</language><rights>Attribution 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</rights><rights>Creative Commons Attribution License 2.0 UK</rights><rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/uk/</rights><publisher>Wiley on behalf of the Northern Institute of Philosophy</publisher></simpledc>
