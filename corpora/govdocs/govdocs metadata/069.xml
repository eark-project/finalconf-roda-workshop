The chances manifest propensities: dispositional properties of objects (e.g. a coin's bias). The account is applied to theories of radioactive decay and of how human death risk increases with age, and is used to show how knowledge of propensities underlies apparently a priori derivations of classical chance distributions. Finally it shows how propensities entail indeterminism and are consistent with a Humean view of laws of nature.</description><date>2006-11-25T11:08:36Z</date><date>2006-11-25T11:08:36Z</date><date>1971</date><type>Book or Book Chapter</type><identifier>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/183661</identifier><language>en</language><format>20050792 bytes</format><format>application/pdf</format><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher></simpledc>
