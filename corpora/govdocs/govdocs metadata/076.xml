The final version is available from Wiley via http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tht3.197</description><description>I will understand act-consequentialism as the thesis that our moral reasons are reasons to bring about impersonally good outcomes; consequently, you morally ought not bring about a sub-optimal outcome. By evaluating these consequences impersonally, act-consequentialism faces a familiar complaint: it leaves us without personal permissions to pursue our own projects or relationships at the expense of maximising the good (Williams 1973; Wolf 1982; Scheffler 1982). In this way, act-consequentialism is said to be over-demanding sometimes. I will defend the corollary complaint that act-consequentialism is sometimes under-demanding: it fails to accommodate the fact that we have moral reasons to bear some costs ourselves, rather than pass them off onto others. Let us call these costs “burdens.” To press this objection, I will give three examples of burdens.</description><date>2016-03-14T12:26:49Z</date><date>2016-03-14T12:26:49Z</date><date>2015-12-29</date><type>Article</type><type>accepted version</type><identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tht3.197</identifier><identifier>https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/254446</identifier><language>en</language><publisher>Wiley</publisher></simpledc>
