His reason is that the prevalent B-theoretic account of our attitudes towards the past and future precludes treating our fear of death as unwarranted. I examine his argument and provide a tentative defense of Le Poidevin. I claim that while Burley rightly spots a tension with a non-revisionary approach to our ordinary emotional life, he doesn’t isolate the source of that tension. The real question is how to understand Le Poidevin’s idea that on the B-theory, we and our lives are ‘eternally real’. I then suggest that there is a view of time that does justice to Le Poidevin’s remarks, albeit a strange one. The view takes temporal relations to be quasi-spatial and temporal entities to exist in a totum simul.</description><date>2015-06-09T09:03:05Z</date><date>2015-06-09T09:03:05Z</date><date>2015-06-09</date><type>Article</type><type>accepted version</type><identifier>http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/248340</identifier><identifier>http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11406-015-9638-y</identifier><language>en</language><publisher>Springer</publisher></simpledc>
