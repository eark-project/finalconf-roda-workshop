It is currently under an indefinite embargo pending publication by Johns Hopkins University Press.</description><description>Claims about the beauty of theories and explanations are often inspired by the Platonic vision that&#xD;
beauty will lead us to truth. By contrast, Kant’s aesthetics is commonly regarded as providing the&#xD;
most influential critique of this vision. In this paper I show that this popular contrast is mistaken in&#xD;
important respects. By examining Kant’s views in comparison with those of his immediate&#xD;
contemporaries, A. G. Baumgarten and G. F. Meier, I show that the Kantian position offers an&#xD;
important contender to the Platonic ideal, namely, a conception of the beauty of science that is&#xD;
independent of the science of beauty.</description><description>I gratefully acknowledge the support of the Leverhulme Trust and CRASSH,&#xD;
