The page numbers and pencilled alterations were made by R. B. Braithwaite after Ramsey's death in 1930, in preparing it for publication. The note, which is now out of copyright, is republished in F. P. Ramsey: Philosophical Papers, edited by D. H. Mellor, Cambridge: Cambridge Unversity Press, 1990, pp.137-9.</description><description>This note is, in effect, a postscript to Ramsey's 'Theories'. It argues that to assert the existence of a causal quality (e.g. mass) is merely to affirm the consequences of a theory that invokes it.</description><date>2007-08-28T02:17:11Z</date><date>2007-08-28T02:17:11Z</date><date>1931</date><type>Book or Book Chapter</type><identifier>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/194723</identifier><language>en</language><publisher>Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trubner</publisher></simpledc>
