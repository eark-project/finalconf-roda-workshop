While these relations share most of their formal properties, they need not share all of them. Nor need other mereological principles be true of all kinds of partâ€“whole pairs. In particular, it is argued that the principle of unrestricted composition, that any two or more entities have a mereological sum, while true of sets and propositions, is false of things and events.</description><date>2006-06-06T21:35:42Z</date><date>2006-06-06T21:35:42Z</date><date>2006-06</date><type>Article</type><identifier>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/183628</identifier><language>en</language><format>65091 bytes</format><format>application/pdf</format><publisher>South African Journal of Philosophy</publisher></simpledc>
