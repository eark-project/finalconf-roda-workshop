Few would now share this view. But if other animals have conscious lives, what are they like, how do they differ from ours, and how would we ever know anything about them? This lecture will address this question by looking at the kinds of thoughts we might share with animals, and looking at philosophical and empirical arguments for how our thoughts might differ from theirs.</description><date>2012-03-23T12:25:17Z</date><date>2012-03-23T12:25:17Z</date><date>2010</date><type>Article</type><type>not applicable</type><identifier>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/241942</identifier><rights>Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 2.0 UK: England &amp; Wales</rights><rights>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/</rights><publisher>Faculty of Philosophy, University of Cambridge</publisher></simpledc>
