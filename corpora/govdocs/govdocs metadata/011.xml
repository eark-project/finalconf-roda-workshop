The page numbers and pencilled alterations were made by R. B. Braithwaite after Ramsey's death in 1930, in preparing it for publication. The note, which is now out of copyright, is republished in F. P. Ramsey: Philosophical Papers, edited by D. H. Mellor, Cambridge: Cambridge Unversity Press, 1990, pp. 95-6.</description><description>This note is a postscript to Ramsey's 'Truth and Probability'. It replaces that article's  psychological reading of subjective probability with a reading of it as a consistency condition on the theory that we act to maximise expected utility.</description><date>2007-08-28T02:31:10Z</date><date>2007-08-28T02:31:10Z</date><date>1931</date><type>Book or Book Chapter</type><identifier>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/194724</identifier><publisher>Kegan Paul, Trench &amp; Trubner</publisher></simpledc>
