The first five are on aspects of the mind: on our 'selves', their supposed subjectivity and how we refer to them, on the nature of conscious belief and on computational and physical theories of the mind. The next five deal with dispositions, natural kinds, laws of nature and how they involve natural necessity, universals and objective chances, and the relation between properties and predicates. Then follow three papers about the relations between time, change and causation, the nature of individual causes and effects and of the causal relations between them, and how causation depends on chance. The last three papers discuss the relation between chance and degrees of belief, give a solution to the problem of induction and argue for an objective interpretation of normative decision theory.</description><date>2007-05-14T15:54:34Z</date><date>2007-05-14T15:54:34Z</date><date>1991</date><type>Book or Book Chapter</type><identifier>http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/194180</identifier><language>en</language><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher></simpledc>
