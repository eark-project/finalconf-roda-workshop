In addition, two trials previously included as abstracts have now been published as full articles (Chotigeat 2003, Supapannachart 2002). <P>The current review includes a total of 16 trials enrolling 876 infants. The increase in sample size made the point estimates more precise and changed the results of one important outcome. In the previous review there was a statistically significant increase in chronic lung disease in the ibuprofen group. Although a trend towards an increase in chronic lung disease remained in this review, the summary estimates did not reach statistical significance. In this review, the outcome of serum/plasma levels of creatinine following treatment was included and the results showed significantly lower levels in the ibuprofen group. As in previous reviews, the risk of decreased urine output was lower in the ibuprofen group. There is not enough data available regarding the effectiveness of oral ibuprofen to close a patent ductus arteriosus. One case of pulmonary hypertension associated with ibuprofen treatment was reported in one trial.<P>Long-term neurodevelopmental data are still lacking. <P>Based on the available evidence clinicians may prefer one of the two drugs currently available for closure of a patent ductus arterious over the other:<BR>a) Either drug is effective in closing a patent ductus arterious <BR>b) Ibuprofen may be preferred because of its less negative impact on the kidney function<BR>c) Indomethacin may be preferred because of the trend towards increase in chronic lung disease in the ibuprofen group and the potential risk of pulmonary hypertension associated with the use of ibuprofen<P>This review has previously been updated in 2005 (Ohlsson 2005). An updated search in July 2005 identified one trial of ibuprofen versus placebo, but the results were not reported unblinded to group. However, the search identified three trials that compared ibuprofen to indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA. The addition of the results from these three trials confirmed our previous findings that ibuprofen is no more effective than indomethacin and may cause more adverse effects. There were no important changes to the conclusions of that review.<P>An updated search in October 2004 found no new eligible trials for inclusion in this review. <P>There was no trial identified using mefenamic acid in the original review or in any of the updates.<P><H2>Dates</H2>Date review re-formatted:   /  /    <BR>Date new studies sought but none found:   /  /    <BR>Date new studies found but not yet included/excluded:   /  /    <BR>Date new studies found and included/excluded:   /  /    <BR>Date reviewers' conclusions section amended:   /  /    <BR>Date comment/criticism added:   /  /    <BR>Date response to comment/criticisms added:   /  /    <BR><H1>Text of review</H1><h2>Synopsis</h2><br>Ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin at closing a PDA in a very preterm or very small newborn, and has fewer adverse effects on kidney function. Ibuprofen may be associated with an increased risk of pulmonary complications including chronic lung disease and rarely pulmonary hypertension. <br><br>A common complication for very preterm (premature) or very small babies is PDA (patent ductus arteriosus). PDA is an open channel between the lungs and heart. It should close after birth, but sometimes remains open because of the baby's premature stage of development. PDA can lead to life-threatening complications. The usual treatment for PDA is indomethacin, a drug that will successfully close the PDA in the majority of cases, but can cause serious adverse effects. Another option is the drug ibuprofen. This review of 16 trials found that ibuprofen is as effective as indomethacin and causes fewer transient adverse effects on the kidneys. Information on whether ibuprofen confers any important long-term advantages on development or not is not known. Long-term follow-up studies to 18 months of age and to the age of school entry are needed to decide whether ibuprofen or indomethacin is the drug of choice for closing a PDA. <br><br><h2>Abstract</h2><br><br><h3>Background</h3><br>A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) complicates the clinical course of preterm infants, increasing their risks of developing chronic lung disease (CLD), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). Indomethacin is used as standard therapy to close a PDA, but is associated with reduced blood flow to the brain, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Ibuprofen, another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, may be as effective as indomethacin, with fewer side effects.<br><br><h3>Objectives</h3><br>To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo or no intervention for closing a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.<br>To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors (including indomethacin, mefenamic acid) for closing a PDA in preterm and/or low birth weight infants.<br><br><h3>Search strategy</h3><br>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ibuprofen to placebo or indomethacin or mefenamic acid for therapy of PDA were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2007), MEDLINE (1996 - August 2007), CINAHL (1982 - August 2007), EMBASE (1980 - August 2007), reference lists of published RCTs and abstracts from the Pediatric Academic Societies and the European Society for Pediatric Research meetings published in Pediatric Research (1991 - April 2005) or on their website (to August 2007). No language restrictions were applied.<br><br><h3>Selection criteria</h3><br>1) Design: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials <br>2) Population: Preterm (&lt; 37 weeks gestational age) or low birth weight infants (&lt; 2500 g) with a clinically or echocardiographically diagnosed PDA <br>3) Intervention: Administration of ibuprofen (orally or intravenously) for the closure of PDA <br>4) Outcomes: At least one of the following outcomes were reported: failure to close a PDA, mortality, surgical ductal ligation, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), NEC, decreased urine output, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), chronic lung disease (CLD), sepsis, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, duration of supplementary oxygen, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospital stay, and serum creatinine levels following treatment. <br><br><h3>Data collection &amp; analysis</h3><br>At least two review authors worked independently at each step of the original review, then compared results and resolved differences. The current update was conducted by one review author (AO). Methodological quality of eligible studies was assessed according to blinding of randomization, of intervention and of outcome assessment, and completeness of follow up. Weighted treatment effects, calculated using RevMan 4.2.10, included typical relative risk (RR), typical risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or harm (NNH), and weighted mean difference (WMD), all with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed effect model was used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests including the I-squared test (I<sup>2</sup>) were performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data.<br><br><h3>Main results</h3><br>No studies using mefenamic acid were identified. Sixteen studies enrolling 876 infants were identified. Four additional trials were identified for this update and two studies published as abstracts were now available as full articles. One study compared ibuprofen to placebo, but the results were not reported unblinded to intervention group. Fifteen studies including 740 infants compared the effectiveness of ibuprofen to indomethacin for the closure of a PDA. For the primary outcome (failure of ductal closure), there was no statistically significant difference between ibuprofen and indomethacin groups [typical RR 0.99 (95% CI 0.78, 1.27); typical RD 0.00 (95% CI -0.06, 0.06)]. There were no statistically significant differences in mortality, reopening of the ductus, need for surgical duct ligation, duration of ventilator support, duration of supplementary oxygen, pulmonary hemorrhage, pulmonary hypertension, CLD, IVH, PVL, NEC, intestinal perforation, gastrointestinal bleed, time to full enteral feeds, time to regain birth weight, ROP, sepsis, duration of hospitalization. Ibuprofen treatment was associated with statistically significantly lower serum creatinine levels after treatment (6 trials, 336 infants; WMD - 8.2 (95% CI -13.3, -3.2) mmol/L and lower incidence of 'decreased urine output' [3 trials, 336 infants; typical RR; 0.22 (95% CI 0.09, 0.51); typical RD -0.12 (95% CI -0.18, -0.06); NNT 8 (95% CI 6,17)]. There was moderate heterogeneity of treatment effect for the outcomes 'time to regain birth weight' and 'decreased urine output". Heterogeneity was not noted for other outcomes. For several of these outcomes, the sample size was small and the estimates imprecise. There are not enough data available regarding the effectiveness of oral ibuprofen compared with indomethacin to close a PDA [3 trials, 69 infants; typical RR 1.41 (95% CI 0.68, 2.93); typical RD 0.10 (95% CI -0.10, 0.30)]. Pulmonary hypertension was noted in one infant receiving ibuprofen to close a PDA enrolled in a trial in this review and an additional report of such a case was identified from the literature. <br><br><h3>Reviewers' conclusions</h3><br>No statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin in closing a PDA was found. Ibuprofen compared with indomethacin reduces the risk of oliguria and is associated with lower serum creatinine levels following treatment. Pulmonary hypertension has been observed in three infants after prophylactic use of ibuprofen and one infant receiving ibuprofen for treatment in this review developed pulmonary hypertension. One additional case of pulmonary hypertension following treatment with ibuprofen to close a PDA was identified from the literature. The available data support the use of either drug for the treatment of a PDA. As both drugs are equally effective in closing a PDA, the clinician needs to weigh the potential side effects of one drug vs. the other when making a decision which drug to use. The most urgent research question to be answered is whether ibuprofen compared to indomethacin confers an improved rate of intact survival (survival without impairment) at 18 months corrected age and at the age of school entry. <br><br>
<h2>Background<a name="Background"></a></h2>
<br>Normal fetal circulation is dependent on the placenta and the patency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) (<a href="#Mathew 1998">Mathew 1998</a>). Following birth and with the separation of the placenta and initiation of breathing, the circulation changes and closure of the ductus starts immediately (<a href="#Mathew 1998">Mathew 1998</a>). However, in about a third of low birth weight [(LBW) &lt; 2500 g] infants the PDA remains open, especially during early days of life (<a href="#Ellison 1983">Ellison 1983</a>). In preterm neonates, the PDA often fails to close. The hemodynamic instability caused by the left to right shunt and associated run off has been shown to cause renal or gastrointestinal effects including spontaneous perforation and necrotizing enterocolitis, chronic lung disease and, if not managed, may lead to death (<a href="#Cotton 1979">Cotton 1979</a>). The presence of a PDA is associated with reduced middle cerebral artery blood flow velocity (<a href="#Weir 1999">Weir 1999</a>). <br><br>The surgical closure of the symptomatic PDA reduces duration of mechanical ventilation, improves hemodynamics and improves lung compliance (<a href="#Cotton 1978">Cotton 1978</a>; <a href="#Naulty 1978">Naulty 1978</a>). However, medical treatment is still considered the treatment of choice in the majority of cases because of the risks related to the surgery. In a recent large Canadian cohort (n = 3,779) of very low birth weight (VLBW &lt; 1500 grams) infants, 28% required treatment for a PDA; 75% were treated with indomethacin alone, 8% with surgical ligation alone, and 17% required both indomethacin and surgical ligation (<a href="#Lee 2000">Lee 2000</a>). Infants with lower birth weight were more likely to be treated surgically (<a href="#Lee 2000">Lee 2000</a>). <br><br>Prostaglandins play a significant role in keeping the ductus arteriosus patent (<a href="#Mathew 1998">Mathew 1998</a>). PDA related morbidity and mortality have been shown to be reduced with the use of indomethacin, which acts as an inhibitor of prostaglandin forming cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (<a href="#Mahony 1982">Mahony 1982</a>; <a href="#Stefano 1991">Stefano 1991</a>). However, indomethacin use has been associated with transient or permanent derangement of renal function, necrotizing enterocolitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage or perforation, alteration of platelet function and impairment of cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood flow velocity (<a href="#Seyberth 1983">Seyberth 1983</a>; <a href="#Wolf 1989">Wolf 1989</a>; <a href="#Edwards 1990">Edwards 1990</a>; <a href="#Ohlsson 1993">Ohlsson 1993</a>). These negative effects of indomethacin are possibly related to mechanisms other than inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. <br><br>In a large trial (n = 1202) in extremely low birth weight infants, indomethacin prophylaxis did not significantly improve the rate of survival without neurosensory impairment at 18 months despite the fact that it reduces the frequency of PDA and severe periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage (<a href="#Schmidt  2001">Schmidt  2001</a>). In a Cochrane review, it was confirmed that prophylactic treatment with indomethacin has a number of short-term benefits, in particular a reduction in symptomatic PDA, the need for ductal ligation and severe intraventricular haemorrhage (<a href="#Fowlie 2002">Fowlie 2002</a>). The same review found no evidence of either benefit or harm concerning longer-term outcomes including neurodevelopment (<a href="#Fowlie 2002">Fowlie 2002</a>). <br><br>The complications associated with the use of indomethacin have encouraged the search for an alternate drug to treat a PDA. Ibuprofen, a propionic acid derivative and non-selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, has been reported to close a PDA, but without gastrointestinal hemodynamic disturbance and potentially harmful cerebral side effects (<a href="#Coceani 1979">Coceani 1979</a>; <a href="#Varvarigou 1996">Varvarigou 1996</a>; <a href="#Chemtob 1991">Chemtob 1991</a>). Ibuprofen has been shown to have some neuroprotective effects in animal models (<a href="#Chemtob 1990">Chemtob 1990</a>; <a href="#Pellicer 1999">Pellicer 1999</a>). Ibuprofen also enhances cerebral autoregulation without affecting cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolism or intestinal or renal hemodynamics (<a href="#Grosfeld 1983">Grosfeld 1983</a>; <a href="#Kaplan 1994">Kaplan 1994</a>, <a href="#Hardy 1996">Hardy 1996</a>). <br><br>Another non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, mefenamic acid, has been reported to close a PDA (<a href="#Sakhalkar 1992">Sakhalkar 1992</a>; <a href="#Ito 1994">Ito 1994</a>; <a href="#Niopas 1994">Niopas 1994</a>). <br><br>One previous meta-analysis of three trials of small sample size (<a href="#Van Overmeire 1997">Van Overmeire 1997</a>; <a href="#Van Overmeire 1998">Van Overmeire 1998</a>; <a href="#Patel 2000">Patel 2000</a>) suggested that ibuprofen may be as effective as indomethacin in closing a PDA (<a href="#Ohlsson 2000">Ohlsson 2000</a>). The meta-analysis included a total of 176 neonates who were randomized to either ibuprofen (10 mg/kg followed at 24 and 48 hours later by a dose of 5 mg/kg) or indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg at 12 hours interval for 3 doses). The relative risk for failure of PDA closure using ibuprofen vs. indomethacin was 1.0 (95% confidence interval 0.85, 1.17) (<a href="#Ohlsson 2000">Ohlsson 2000</a>). This meta-analysis was included in a commentary on a publication of a randomized controlled trial (<a href="#Patel 2000">Patel 2000</a>), and the publication type did not allow for detailed description of the methodology used or the inclusion of outcomes other than ductal closure (<a href="#Ohlsson 2000">Ohlsson 2000</a>). Additional trials have been published since the year 2000. A systematic review according to Cochrane methodology was therefore justified as were the current and previous updates as new trials were identified.<br><br><h2>Objectives</h2><br>Primary objectives:<br><br><ul><li>To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to placebo or no intervention for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants</li><li>To determine the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors for closing a patent ductus arteriosus in preterm and/or low birth weight infants</li></ul><br>Secondary objectives:<br><br>To determine in subgroup analyses the effectiveness and safety of ibuprofen to close a PDA in relation to the following criteria:<br><ul><li>Gestational age (&lt;28 weeks, 28 - 32 weeks, 33 - 36 weeks)</li><li>Birth weight (&lt;1000 g, 1000 - 1500 g, 1501 - 2500 g)</li><li>Method used to diagnose a PDA (by ECHO criteria or only by clinical criteria)</li><li>A dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg of ibuprofen followed by 5 mg/kg of ibuprofen 24 and 48 hours later, or 0.2 mg/kg of indomethacin at 12 hours intervals for three doses</li><li>Oral ibuprofen vs. indomethacin (this has been added in 2007 as a new comparison as studies now have used oral ibuprofen)</li></ul><br><br><h2>Criteria for considering studies for this review</h2><br><br><h3>Types of studies</h3><br>Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials <br><br><h3>Types of participants</h3><br>Preterm infants &lt; 37 weeks gestational age or low-birth-weight infants (&lt; 2500 g) with a PDA diagnosed either clinically or by ECHO criteria in the neonatal period (&lt; 28 days).<br><br><h3>Types of interventions</h3><br>Therapeutic use of ibuprofen (orally or intravenously) for closure of PDA compared to control infants who received no intervention, placebo, indomethacin or other cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors.<br><br><h3>Types of outcome measures</h3><br>Primary outcome:<br><ul><li>Failure of permanent PDA closure within a week of administration of the first dose of ibuprofen (PDA diagnosed either clinically or by ECHO criteria). </li></ul><br>Secondary outcomes:<br><ul><li>All cause mortality during initial hospital stay</li><li>Neonatal mortality (death during the first 28 days of life)</li><li>Infant mortality (death during the first year of life)</li><li>Reopening of the ductus arteriosus</li><li>Need for surgical closure of the PDA</li><li>Need for treatment with indomethacin to close the PDA*</li><li>Duration of ventilator support (days)</li><li>Duration of need for supplementary oxygen (days)</li><li>Pneumothorax</li><li>Pulmonary hemorrhage*</li><li>Pulmonary hypertension*</li><li>Chronic lung disease (CLD) (defined as oxygen requirement at 28 days postnatal age in addition to compatible clinical and roentgenographic findings) </li><li>Chronic lung disease (CLD) (defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age in addition to compatible clinical and roentgenographic findings)</li><li>Chronic lung disease (age at diagnosis not stated)*</li><li>Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (Grade I-IV)</li><li>Severe intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) (Grade III-IV)</li><li>Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)</li><li>Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) (any stage) </li><li>Intestinal perforation*</li><li>Gastrointestinal bleed</li><li>Time to full enteral feeds (postnatal age at time of achieving full enteral feeds)</li><li>Time to regain birth weight* (days)</li><li>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (according to the international classification of ROP)</li><li>Definite sepsis (clinical symptoms and signs of sepsis and a positive bacterial culture in a specimen obtained from normally sterile fluids or tissue obtained at autopsy)</li><li>Decreased urine output (defined as &lt; 1 cc/kg/hr)</li><li>Serum/plasma levels of creatinine (mmol/L) after treatment*</li><li>Increase in serum/plasma levels of creatinine (mmol/L) after treatment*</li><li>Duration of hospitalization (total length of hospitalization from birth to discharge home or death) (days)</li><li>Neurodevelopmental outcome (neurodevelopmental outcome assessed by a standardized and validated assessment tool and/or a child developmental specialist) at any age reported (outcome data will be grouped at 12, 18, 24 months if available)</li><li>Bilirubin albumin binding*</li><li>Other side effects reported by the authors</li></ul><br>Outcomes marked with an asterisk (*) were not included in the original protocol or previous updates of this review.

Other data bases searched included: EMBASE (1980 - August 2007); CINAHL (1982 - August 2007); and the reference list of identified trials and abstracts published in Pediatric Research (1991 - April Issue, 2005, and electronically on the PAS web site from 2006 - 2007) from conference proceedings of the Pediatric Academic Societies (PAS) and the European Society of Pediatric Research. No new trials since the first publication of this review were identified in the searches undertaken in October 2004. The searches in July 2005 identified four new trials of which one was published in abstract form. A search by first review author and coauthors of any abstracts identified in Pediatric Research was done in July 2005 in MEDLINE and EMBASE to try and identify any corresponding full manuscripts published. Identified trials were entered into Science Citation Index to identify articles that quoted the original studies and to ascertain any additional potential studies for inclusion in the review. References lists of published narrative and systematic reviews were reviewed. Unpublished data were not sought, but authors of some published trials were contacted to clarify or provide additional information. In addition the literature was search for any reports (regardless of publication type) of pulmonary hypertension associated with the treatment with ibuprofen or indomethacin. No language restrictions were applied. <br><br>
<h2>Methods<a name="Methods"></a> of the review</h2>
<br>The standardized review methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group (CNRG) were used to assess the methodological quality of studies.<br><br>All abstracts and published full reports identified as potentially relevant by the literature search were assessed for inclusion in the review by two review authors (AO, SS). Each review author extracted data separately using pre-designed data abstraction forms. The review authors compared results and resolved differences. One review author (AO) entered data into RevMan 4.2.10 and the other review author (SS) cross-checked the printout against his own data abstraction forms and errors were corrected by consensus. <br>For the studies identified as abstracts, some primary authors were contacted to ascertain whether a full publication is available if the full paper was not identified in an electronic data base. The current update (2007) and the update conducted in 2005 were performed by one review author (AO).<br><br>The quality of included trials was evaluated independently by the reviewers, using the following criteria:<br>Blinding of randomization? <br>Blinding of intervention?<br>Blinding of outcome measure assessment?<br>Completeness of follow up?<br><br>There were three potential answers to these questions - yes, can't tell, no<br><br>Information from the primary author was obtained if the published article provided inadequate information for the review. Retrieved articles were assessed and data were abstracted independently by the reviewers. For the original review, independent quality assessments were conducted by two review authors, who were not blinded to authors, institution or journal of publication. The updates in 2005 and 2007 were conducted by one review author (AO). <br><br>The statistical analyses followed the recommendations of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. A weighted treatment effect was calculated using the RevMan 4.2.10 package. The estimates of treatment effects included typical relative risk (RR), typical risk difference (RD), number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) or number needed to harm (NNH) for dichotomous outcomes, and weighted mean difference (WMD) for continuous outcomes. All estimates of treatment effects are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A fixed effect model was used for meta-analyses. Heterogeneity tests including the I- squared test (I<sup>2</sup>) were performed to assess the appropriateness of pooling the data. Planned subgroup analyses were performed according to the criteria listed under objectives. As we have noted discrepancies between numbers enrolled in trials as reported in abstracts and full text reports (<a href="#Walia 2000">Walia 2000</a>), sensitivity analyses were performed excluding abstracts. No additional sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.<br><br><h2>Description of studies</h2><br>There was one study identified that compared ibuprofen to placebo (<a href="#Aranda 2005">Aranda 2005</a>). Fifteen studies comparing one or several doses of ibuprofen to one or several doses of indomethacin were identified and included in the review. Two additional studies are listed under "Classification pending" (Hammerman 2006; Hammerman 2007). In Hammerman 2006 the results were provided in graphic form and in Hammerman 2007 the number of infants enrolled in the two study groups were not stated. For details see "Table of Characteristics of Included Studies". No randomized controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of mefenamic acid were identified. <br><br><b>IBUPROFEN VERSUS PLACEBO</b><br><br>The study by Aranda and coworkers (<a href="#Aranda 2005">Aranda 2005</a>) was a multi-centre study conducted at 15 sites in the US:<br><br><ul><li>Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of i.v. ibuprofen with placebo for the early treatment of PDA in preterm infants with evidence of ductal shunting by echocardiography.</li><li>Population: 136 preterm infants (BW 500 to 1000 g) with evidence of ductal shunting by an echocardiogram within 72 hours after birth.</li><li>Intervention: Infants were allocated to either a three day treatment course of i.v. ibuprofen of 10 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg (n = 68) or placebo (saline) (n = 68). </li><li>Outcomes:The primary outcome measure was the proportion of infants that required rescue treatment for PDA (indomethacin or surgery) on or prior to study day 14.

For 'Failure to close a PDA', the funnel plot was asymmetric with a relative absence of small studies having a protective effect of ibuprofen vs. indomethacin. For the outcome 'Chronic lung disease at any age' the funnel plot was asymmetric with a relative absence of small studies not having a protective effect of ibuprofen vs. indomethacin.<br><br><h2>Discussion</h2><br>One study (n = 136) (<a href="#Aranda 2005">Aranda 2005</a>) published in abstract form compared ibuprofen to placebo but the results were not reported according to intervention group. Two additional studies published in abstract form were identified and are currently listed as "Classification pending" (Hammerman 2006, Hammerman 2007).<br><br>To date, the outcomes of 740 neonates with echocardiographically diagnosed PDA enrolled in randomized controlled trials comparing ibuprofen to indomethacin for the closure of PDA have been reported. Biochemical and physiological data favour ibuprofen, as it has potentially less adverse effects on the kidneys, the gut and the brain. For the main outcome (failure of ductal closure) in this review, there was no statistically significant difference between ibuprofen and indomethacin groups in either primary or subgroup analyses. There were no statistically significant differences in all cause mortality, neonatal mortality, reopening of the ductus arteriosus, surgical duct ligation, duration of ventilator support, IVH, PVL, NEC, time to full enteral feeds, ROP, sepsis, duration of hospital stay or gastrointestinal bleed. The incidence of decreased urine output (&lt; 1 cc/kg/hr) was lower in the ibuprofen group as compared to the indomethacin group [NNT 8 (95% CI 6-17)]. These two outcomes were the only statistically significant clinical findings favouring ibuprofen. <br><br>In the previous update (Ohlsson 2005) of this review, 'Chronic lung disease defined as oxygen requirement at 28 days postnatally' was statistically significantly more likely to occur in the ibuprofen group. There was a similar trend for chronic lung disease at 36 weeks postmenstrual age and for days in supplementary oxygen. There is no biologically plausible explanation for this finding. In this review, a trend in the same direction remained. In a secondary post hoc analysis, the typical RR for 'Chronic lung disease (at any age reported and studies using oral ibuprofen excluded)' was 1.25 (95% CI 0.98, 1.60) and the typical RD was 0.08 (95% CI 0.00, 0.15). As in another exploratory analysis, oral ibuprofen seemed less effective than indomethacin. It is postulated that the impact on the incidence of both ductal closure and CLD is decreased with oral ibuprofen. Prospective studies would have to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis. The funnel plot for the outcome of 'CLD (at any age reported)' was asymmetric with a relative absence of studies not having a protective effect of ibuprofen vs. indomethacin.<br><br>The results of this review are based on small to moderately large trials. For many of the outcomes, the sample size was too small to detect a significant difference and the estimates are imprecise. There was significant between-study heterogeneity for only two of the secondary outcomes ['time to regain birth weight' and 'decreased urine output (&lt; 1 cc/kg/hr)']. The funnel plot for the primary outcome 'Failure to close a PDA' was asymmetric, with a relative absence of smaller studies having a protective effect of ibuprofen vs. indomethacin. <br><br>There are no data on long-term follow-up, which is a serious concern. As mentioned in the background, prophylactic use of indomethacin does reduce the risk of severe IVH and surgical duct ligation but does not confer any significant advantages at 18 months corrected age with regards to intact survival (<a href="#Fowlie 2002">Fowlie 2002</a>; <a href="#Schmidt  2001">Schmidt  2001</a>). <br><br>One study of the prophylactic use of ibuprofen was stopped after 135 infants had been enrolled (<a href="#Gournay 2002">Gournay 2002</a>). Three infants developed severe hypoxemia in the ibuprofen group. Hypoxemia was thought to be due to pulmonary hypertension, as echocardiography showed severely decreased pulmonary blood flow. Hypoxemia resolved quickly on inhaled nitric oxide (<a href="#Gournay 2002">Gournay 2002</a>). The authors postulated that this could be due to early administration of ibuprofen (&lt; 6 hours) preventing the normal fall in pulmonary vascular resistance, acidification of their ibuprofen solution (buffered with tromethamine) causing precipitation and microembolism in the lungs or due to a specific effect of ibuprofen. This adverse effect has not been reported in other trials using ibuprofen for prophylaxis of PDA (<a href="#Shah 2006">Shah 2006</a>). In the current review, one randomized controlled trial reported one case of pulmonary hypertension (<a href="#Adamska 2005">Adamska 2005</a>) in the ibuprofen group. <br><br>In an extensive search of the literature, including study designs other than randomized controlled trials, one additional case-report following L-lysine ibuprofen therapy in a preterm infant with a patent ductus arteriosus (<a href="#Bellini 2006">Bellini 2006</a>) was identified. <br><br>Another potential side effect of ibuprofen is decreased bilirubin albumin binding capacity. In a randomized controlled trial reported in abstract form, Hammerman and co-workers (Hammerman 2007) reported that ibuprofen appears to interfere with bilirubin albumin binding to a greater degree than does indomethacin treatment. Data were reported for only 4 ibuprofen treated and 6 indomethacin treated infants. In this review, the study was classified with another abstract from the same group, and possibly from the same study, as "Classification pending" (Hammerman 2006, Hammerman 2007). <br> <br>In view of the lack of long-term outcome data and potential side effects for both drugs, one drug cannot be recommended over the other as the therapy of choice for a PDA. <br><br>Indomethacin has been shown to decrease cerebral blood flow in a preterm infant with PDA (<a href="#Ohlsson 1993">Ohlsson 1993</a>), while ibuprofen has been shown to have some neuro-protective effects in animal models (<a href="#Chemtob 1990">Chemtob 1990</a>; <a href="#Pellicer 1999">Pellicer 1999</a>). Future studies comparing the two drugs should include long-term follow-up (intact survival) to at least 18 months of age. Sample size calculations could be based on this review and two related Cochrane reviews (<a href="#Fowlie 2002">Fowlie 2002</a>; <a href="#Shah 2006">Shah 2006</a>). <br><br>Coceani and co-workers (<a href="#Coceani 2005">Coceani 2005</a>) suggested that a membrane bound prostaglandin E synthase inhibitor, once developed for therapeutic use, could become the agent of choice for PDA treatment, particularly when preterm birth is complicated by infectious or inflammatory conditions.<br><br><h2>Reviewers' conclusions</h2><br><br><h3>Implications for practice</h3><br>No statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of ibuprofen compared to indomethacin in closing the PDA was found. Ibuprofen reduces the risk of oliguria. However, ibuprofen may increase the risk for chronic lung disease, and pulmonary hypertension has been observed in three infants after the prophylactic use of ibuprofen, and in one case in this review and in an additional case report for the treatment of a PDA. Based on currently available information ibuprofen does not appear to confer any net benefits over indomethacin for the treatment of a PDA. Either ibuprofen or indomethacin can be used to close a PDA, but the clinician needs to be aware that both drugs are associated with (potentially serious) adverse effects. <br><br><h3>Implications for research</h3><br>Future research should focus on long-term follow-up (intact survival) to at least 18 months corrected age. and preferably to the age of school entry <br><br><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><br>We are thankful to Ms. Elizabeth Uleryk for her assistance in the search of the literature and to Ms. Tara Pourdowlat, RN, for help in translating the study by Akisu (<a href="#Akisu 2001">Akisu 2001</a>) from Turkish to English.
