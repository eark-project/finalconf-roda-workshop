 Quick Bibliography Series 
 Bibliographies in the Quick Bibliography series of the
 National Agricultural Library (NAL), are intended primarily for
 current awareness, and as the title of the series implies, are
 not in-depth and exhaustive. However, the citations are a
 substantial resource for recent investigations on a given topic. 
 They also serve the purpose of bringing the literature of
 agriculture to the interested user who, in many cases, could not
 access it by any other means.  The bibliographies are derived
 from online searches of the AGRICOLA database.  Timeliness of
 topic and evidence of extensive interest are the selection
 criteria.  Send suggestions for Quick Bibliography topics to
 wqic@nalusda.gov
 
 The author/searcher determines the purpose, length, and search
 strategy of the Quick Bibliography.  Information regarding
 these is available from the author/searcher. The inclusion or
 omission of a particular publication or citation should not be
 construed as endorsement or disapproval. An author and subject
 index is provided along with the search strategy.
 
 PLEASE NOTE:  If Quick Bibliography files are copied and/or
 distributed, please include in all copies the information

 Abstract:  Collecting undisturbed subsurface soil samples in
 noncohesive, heaving sandy environments below the water table
 has been extremely difficult using conventional soil sampling
 equipment. Several modifications of the conventional hollow-
 stem auger coring procedures were adapted, which allowed
 collection of depth-discreet soil samples in very fluid,
 heaving sands. These methods were used where accurate
 subsurface characterization of the contamination of RCRA and
 CERCLA sites was essential. Cohesionless cores were
 consistently retrieved, aseptically extruded from the core
 barrel inside an anaerobic environmental chamber, and
 preserved in the field. The physical, chemical, and biological
 integrity of discreet soil intervals was maintained for
 laboratory analysis. Statistical analysis of repeated
 collection of soil samples from the same depth intervals in
 nearby boreholes was documented.

 Biodegradation of creosote and pentachlorophenol in

 Abstract:  Shake flask studies examined the rate and extent of
 biodegradation of pentachlorophenol (PCP) and 42 components of
 coal-tar creosote present in contaminated groundwater
 recovered from the American Creosote Works Superfund site,
 Pensacola, Fla. The ability of indigenous soil microorganisms
 to remove these contaminants from aqueous solutions was
 determined by gas chromatographic analysis of organic extracts
 of biotreated groundwater. Changes in potential environmental
 and human health hazards associated with the biodegradation of
 this material were determined at intervals by Microtox assays
 and fish toxicity and teratogenicity tests. After 14 days of
 incubation at 30 degrees C, indigenous microorganisms
 effectively removed 100, 99, 94, 88, and 87% of measured
 phenolic and lower-molecular-weight polycyclic aromatic
 hydrocarbons (PAHs) and S-heterocyclic, N-heterocyclic, and O-
 heterocyclic constituents of creosote, respectively. However,
 only 53% of the higher-molecular-weight PAHs were degraded;
 PCP was not removed. Despite the removal of a majority of the
 organic contaminants through biotreatment, only a slight
 decrease in the toxicity and teratogenicity of biotreated
 groundwater was observed. Data suggest that toxicity and
 teratogenicity are associated with compounds difficult to
 treat biologically and that one may not necessarily rely on
 indigenous microorganisms to effectively remove these
 compounds in a reasonable time span; to this end, alternative
 or supplemental approaches may be necessary. Similar measures
 of the toxicity and teratogenicity of treated material may
 offer a simple, yet important, guide to bioremediation
 effectiveness.

 Abstract:  The toxicity of mercury and chromium on algal
 community structure have been assessed using in situ N2ase
 activity, pigment diversity, autotrophic index, and 14C uptake
 of algae. The location was in the river Ganga and controlled
 ecosystem pollution experiment enclosures were used. Maximum
 inhibition of algal number was observed at 0.8 micrograms Hg
 mL-1 followed by 8.0 micrograms Cr mL-1. Unicellular forms,
 except for Anorthoneis excentrica, were very sensitive to test
 metals used. The decline in algal number was concentration
 dependent and metal specific at generic and species levels.
 Complete elimination of three and six species was observed
 respectively at 8.0 micrograms Cr mL-1 and 0.8 micrograms Hg
 mL-1 after 12 days' exposure. Likewise, a concentration-
 dependent and metal-specific increase in autotrophic index and
 pigment diversity of phytoplankton was recorded for Hg and Cr.
 Inhibition of 14C uptake of phytoplankton in Ganga water was
 almost equal (79%) at 0.8 micrograms Hg mL-1 and 8.0
 micrograms Cr mL-1 (78%). Although complete inhibition of in
 situ N(2)ase was observed at 0.8 micrograms Hg mL-1, it was
 only 80% with 8.0 micrograms Cr mL-1. Our study suggests that
 heavy metals inhibit both structural and functional variables
 of phytoplankton in field microcosms. Hence this technique
 seems to hold potential for the biomonitoring of heavy metal
 toxicity in the field.

 Abstract:  Bacterial biosensors incorporating the
 cyanobacterium Synechoccus as the biocatalyst have been
 evaluated by three laboratories as potential biomonitors for
 detecting water pollutants. The biosensors were capable of
 detecting at low concentrations herbicides that interact with
 photosynthetic electron transfer chains. Statistical
 evaluation of the interlaboratory comparison results for
 linuron and atrazine indicated that these compounds can be
 detected rapidly at 50 micrograms/L concentrations.

 Abstract:  The dry deposition of ammonia (NH3) in the field
 was measured simultaneously at increasing distances from a
 point source (a dairy farm) using a biomonitor. The biomonitor
 was Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) grown in pots
 and supplied with 15N-labeled N. The use of 15N improved the
 precision and lowered the detection limit of the method
 compared with calculating the NH3 deposition using the
 difference method (N-balance method). Atmospheric NH3-
 concentrations were measured by drawing air through traps
 containing sulfuric acid. At the end of a 6-wk period in the
 growing season, the deposition of N was 3.0 g N/m2 and 0.7 g
 N/m2 at average atmospheric concentrations of 89 and 6
 microgram NH3-N/m3, respectively. Estimated deposition
 velocities ranged from 0.7 to 3.4 cm/s with an average of 1.6
 cm/s (s.d. 1.2 cm/s).

 Abstract:  The role of sediment-bound or particulate P in
 agricultural runoff in accelerating the biological
 productivity of surface water can be assessed if the
 biological availability of particulate P (PP) is known.
 Previous research has indicated amounts of P extracted from
 deposited river md lake sediments by 0.1 M NaOH to be
 correlated with P uptake by the alga Selenastrum
 capricornutum. This study investigates a modification of this
 extraction to allow routine quantification of potentially
 bioavailable particulate P (BPP) content of agricultural
 runoff from the Reddish Prairies and Rolling Red Plains land
 resource areas. In the proposed method, 20 mL of unfiltered
 runoff is shaken with 180 mL of 0.11 M NaOH for 17 b and BPP
 concentration calculated by subtraction of the soluble P (SP)
 concentration of the runoff sample. Total bioavailable P
 concentration (TBP) of runoff can be represented by BPP plus
 SP concentration. Growth of P-starved S. capricornutum,
 incubated for up to 29 d with runoff sediment from nine
 watersheds, as the sole P source, was correlated (r2 = 0.76 to
 0.95) with potentially BPP content of the added sediment.
 Sample dilution had no effect on the amount of P extracted
 from runoff sediment by NaOH across a range in sediment
 concentration of the extraction medium, equivalent to that
 observed for 95% of the runoff events. If the sediment
 concentration of runoff exceeds 20 g L-1, at smaller runoff
 sample is used in the extraction. The results indicate the
 applicability of the proposed extraction method to quantify
 the bioavailability of P transported in agricultural runoff.
